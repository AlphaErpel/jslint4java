Things to implement:

* Add a maven2 plugin.
** And then add a hudson plugin.

* Add support for non-boolean parameters.

* Allow Main.java to operate on stdin.

* Add a ReportFormatter to output the HTML reports that JSLint can generate.

* Provide an examples directory for the ant task.

* An eclipse plugin, to flag up anything it finds as a warning in the Problems
  view.
